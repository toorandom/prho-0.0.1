BETA Factoring Programm version prho-0.0.1

poor & ugly implementation of Rho Pollard method for factorization
using a little of montecarlo taking a quadratic equation of the form x^2+c
where c can depends of the value taken from the entropy
it can factorize values of 64 bit , 

Installing:


make && make install

using


Compiling:

beck@zeta ~/project/pollard $ make
gcc -Wall -O3 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer -funroll-loops  -c gcdrec.c
gcc -Wall -O3 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer -funroll-loops  -c pollard_rho.c
gcc -Wall -O3 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer -funroll-loops  -c primality_check.c
gcc -Wall -O3 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer -funroll-loops  -c prime.c
gcc -Wall -O3 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer -funroll-loops  -c primes_in_n.c
gcc -lm -o prho gcdrec.o pollard_rho.o primality_check.o prime.o primes_in_n.o


First we usenumber 193243211 to get factors.. i use -p at the final first to check
if its prime (it it is i wont have any factors)
as you can see in argv[2] i have /dev/urandom .. that will give a random value to the init
of the quadratic recursion

beck@zeta ~/project/pollard $ ./prho 193243211 /dev/urandom  -p
Checking if prime... this make take a lot of time...
The number is composite [ OK ]
7*7*3943739=193243211

We got a message from the primality providing sieve algorithm saying that the number is composite [ OK ] so , we can continue finding 
factors..

then we get the factors.

We do the same with the same number , but now we dont use -p because we know that is composite
and we use again /dev/urandom... and we get other factors... because the random value obviusly was different


beck@zeta ~/project/pollard $ ./prho 193243211 /dev/urandom
7*29*951937=193243211
beck@zeta ~/project/pollard $

BUGS:

Too many errors including mem alloc errors (gentoo gcc sends me errors... that i dont understand some times, in other
machines i dont have problems.. those hackers who see this code check primality_check.c & primes_in_n.c
who uses free() ... gentoo sometimes says is double free.. so i decided to comment the free() functions..
i think those functions are ok.. but gentoo says that it isnt ok.

Any comments.. or bugs (there are a lot)
